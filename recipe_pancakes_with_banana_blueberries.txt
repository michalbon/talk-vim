SERVES
4

INGREDIENTS
2 eggs, beaten
150ml milk
2 knobs of butter (1 melted)
150g plain flour
1 tsp baking powder
½ tsp cinnamon
1 tbsp brown sugar
½ tsp salt
1 banana
1 handful of mixed berries
1 tsp maple syrup
METHOD

Whisk the eggs and milk together until foamy, then add a knob of melted butter.
Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl.
Pour in the egg mixture and whisk furiously until lump-free.
Mash the banana and add to the mixture.
Chuck a knob of butter in a hot pan until it bubbles. Ladle the mixture into the pan to form a pancake shape.
Sprinkle a few berries on top of each pancake quickly before it cooks.
Flip over when the pancake begins to bubble and is golden brown underneath.
Cook until it has risen and is golden.
Serve stacked, with a drizzle of maple syrup.
