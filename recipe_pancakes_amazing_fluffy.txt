This is probably the best pancakes recipe ever! Soooo delicious!

Yield: about 19 pancakes

Ingredients: 3/4 cup milk 2 Tbsp white vinegar 1 cup flour 2 Tbsp sugar 1 tsp baking powder 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/2 tsp salt 1 egg 2 Tbsp butter

Preparation: In a small bowl, stir together milk and vinegar. Allow to sit for five minutes. It will look curdled–that is normal.

Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl.

Place butter in a small bowl and melt in the microwave. Once melted, crack the egg into the butter and stir with a fork or whisk until well-combined. Pour butter/egg mixture into milk/vinegar mixture and mix again.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients all at once. Gently stir only until all ingredients are uniformly moist. Don’t over mix or the pancakes will be tough.

Heat a skillet over medium heat, spray with cooking spray, and drop 1/4 cup spoonfuls of batter onto skillet. Cook until bubbles form and pop, then flip and cook the other side.
